# Welcome to my Public Scripts!
This contains the open-source modules which I have used for projects.
Things like my ScriptUNC Helper (crypt lib, isexecutorclosure,
- crypt.encrypt
- crypt.decrypt
- crypt.generatekey
- crypt.hash (all ScriptUNC hashes)
And contains a lua impl of isexecutorclosure for executors which have a broken isexecutorclosure function. Keep in mind the isexecutorclosure fix **requires** getrenv.

Thanks for reading!
